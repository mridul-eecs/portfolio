## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is an open-source, Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It is built on top of Numpy and is one of the most important Python tools for data analyses. In this course, we will introduce Pandas series and dataframes and show how to manipulate them. We will also show how to use Pandas to manipulate and visualize real datasets.

**Prerequisites**: Numpy and Datetime module.
