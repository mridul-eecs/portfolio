## Introduction to Numpy and Matplotlib

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. It is meant to provide an array object that is at least an order of magnitude faster than traditional Python lists. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be efficiently performed. This course introduces the structure of Numpy arrays, show various ways to create them to facilitate numerical calculations. We will also present how to perform array slicing, in-place arithmetic, etc. and how to use built-in mathematical functions for faster computations. Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It can be used in python scripts, shell, web application servers and other graphical user interface toolkits. In this course, we will present the anatomy of a Matplotlib figure and show to produce various 2D plots with Matplotlib.

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python. You might be asked to provide your gmail userid (two days before the beginning the class) in order to be granted access to the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) Science Data Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE).

### Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution

To install (not required) the Anaconda Python distribution on your local platform, follow the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

### Accessing the SMCE Plaform

To log in to the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) Science Data Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE), click on the link:
 
[https://astg.mysmce.com](https://astg.mysmce.com)

It is assumed that you have already provided your gmail userid.
The system will ask you to provide your gmail password or give you automatic access if you are already logged in into gmail (through your browser).
