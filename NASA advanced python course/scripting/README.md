## Python Scripting and Packaging

In this course, we will create from scratch a Python application to solve a specific problem. The process will involve writing Python scripts that will evolve into modules. Then, the modules will be combined to form a package. We will use a YAML file to pass parameters to the Python application. Participants will learn the processes needed for creating their own Python package.

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python. You might be asked to provide your gmail userid (two days before the beginning the class) in order to be granted access to the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) Science Data Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE).

### Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution

To install (not required) the Anaconda Python distribution on your local platform, follow the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

### Jupyter Notebook

You might find it useful to learn little more about Jupyter notebook:

It is assumed that you have already provided your gmail userid.
You will use your gmail credential to automatically access the system. 
It is recommended that you first use a browser to  access your gmail account and then click on the link above.
