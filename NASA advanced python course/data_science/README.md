<a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/blog/python-data-science/">Python is a free, a general-purpose, and portable programming language. It is easy to use with its simple syntax and readability, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.</a> 
Python can be extended via libraries that can be used to tackle problems in machine learning, data analysis, and beyond. It has a vast ecosystem and a dynamic user's community that make Python accessible to everyone.

According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia</a>, **data science** is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.
Because of its features, Python is one of the preferred programming languages that data scientists can use to explore and analyze their datasets.
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">growth of Python in data science</a> has gone hand in hand with that of Pandas, External link  which opened the use of Python for data analysis to a broader audience by enabling it to deal with row-and-column datasets, import CSV files, and much more.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. In additio, it presents Python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas) used for data manipulation and visualization. This course provides the necessary foundations for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

### Objectives
You will learn the following topics:

- Python basic syntax, variables, and types
- Conditional statements and loops
- Data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, set
- Functions and modules
- I/O with text files
- Numpy arrays
- Basic visualization with Matplotlib
- Statistical visualization with Seaborn
- Data manipulation (reading data file, performing statistical analysis, visualization, handling time series data) with Pandas

At the end of this course, participants will be able to write their own Python scripts to read csv files, perform data wrangling, perform basic statiscal analysis and visualize data.

### [Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution](#)
It is not required to have a Python distribution installed on your local machine.
However, we believe that it is important to have one in order to write and run your own Python
applications. We recommend that you install
the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

### [Installing Git](#)
To install Git on your local machine, follow the installation instructions: [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


To fully follow all the topics below, you need to have a **gmail** account in order to access Google Colaboratory. Each course will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
